# Colour Spin
This watchOS application that I built is a game that uses SpriteKit and Gestures. SpriteKit is Appleâ€™s high performance 2D game framework that reigns supreme on iOS and tvOS and is now available for us to use on watchOS too!

I used SpriteKit to add incredible animation and interactive functionality in the app. The player can control this game using the digital crown.

In this game, player has to use the digital crown to line up the central colour with the colour of the ball coming out from the sides. The score is calculated and the labels update accordingly.  

In this project, I learnt to use physics animations, gesture recognizers, SpriteKit classes and methods.
